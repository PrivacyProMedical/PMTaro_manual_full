# 2.9 Polygon (Measurement)

Within the Toolbar, locate and select the Polygon tool. Utilize the brush tool to outline the ROI on the image. Begin by choosing an initial point, then confirm each subsequent point by clicking the mouse. Continue this process until the final point coincides with the starting point, thus forming a closed shape and completing the drawing of the Polygon ROI area.
