Step 2: Then, we will select the necessary components for installation. All of these components must be installed for the software correctly; hence they are all pre-selected by default. Please ensure all components are checked and then click the "Next" button. If users have already installed the corresponding components locally, they can skip the installation step and proceed directly to configuration.
