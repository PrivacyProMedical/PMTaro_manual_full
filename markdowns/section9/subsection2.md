## 9.2.1 Add Plugin
To add a new plugin in the Plugin section, a Python file is required:
A Python file that follows a specific format containing the executable code for data processing.
Users can input these files in two ways:
Drag and drop the files directly from their local system to the input area
Click the input field to open a file selection dialog
Once both files are selected, click "Import" to complete the upload process. Note that both files must conform to specific format requirements. If the format requirements are not met, error messages will be displayed, indicating that modifications to the plugin content are necessary.
