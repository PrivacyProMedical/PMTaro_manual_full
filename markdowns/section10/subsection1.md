# 10.1 New Pipeline
In the Pipelines section, there is a "New" button at the bottom. Clicking this button will automatically direct users to the pipeline interface, where users can design custom pipelines according to their specific requirements.
Each pipeline must contain an Input Node, but a pipeline consisting of only an Input Node is not valid. Once users have completed the pipeline design, click the Save button to preserve configuration.
